	/// Persistent collections are treated as value objects by NHibernate.
	/// ie. they have no independent existence beyond the object holding
	/// a reference to them. Unlike instances of entity classes, they are
	/// automatically deleted when unreferenced and automatically become
	/// persistent when held by a persistent object. Collections can be
	/// passed between different objects (change "roles") and this might
	/// cause their elements to move from one database table to another.
	/// </para>

	/// NHibernate "wraps" a collection in an instance of
	/// <see cref="IPersistentCollection" />. This mechanism is designed
	/// to support tracking of changes to the collection's persistent
	/// state and lazy instantiation of collection elements. The downside
	/// is that only certain abstract collection types are supported and
	/// any extra semantics are lost.

	/// directly, unless extending the "framework" here.

	/// state when the collection is initialized and comparing at flush
	/// time.
